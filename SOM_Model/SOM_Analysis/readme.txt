1) Layer_Visuals.py - View False and Overlay images of the martian surface along with pixels and regions as identified by the SOM model as containing a specific mineral. This code needs to be integrated with the SOM model output, original TER3 files and processed TER3 files (which is a .h5 file).
2) SOM_analysis.py - Various topological views of the SOM model.
